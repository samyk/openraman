# OpenRAMAN

This is a clone of various components of the excellent [OpenRAMAN](https://www.open-raman.org/) project.

I am not the author of the project but wanted a way to track and contribute updates (and the project does not already have a git repo that I'm aware of). The author, Luc, also has a great scientific portfolio, [The Pulsar](https://www.thepulsar.be), and a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thepulsar/).
